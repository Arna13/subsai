00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What exactly is artificial intelligence?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,500
We speak of AI when computer systems perform tasks that usually require human intelligence.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:21,000
This includes, for example, recognizing images, making decisions or engaging in dialogue.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
To do this, the AI systems must be equipped with knowledge and experience.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This can be achieved in two ways.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You can program each individual instruction so that the machine solve the task step by step.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is comparable to a cooking recipe or assembly instructions.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Alternatively, you can use programs that learn from data themselves.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This enables them to detect relevant information, draw conclusions or make predictions.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This is known as machine learning.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We all have probably dealt with AI at some point in our lives.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
When we watch films, listen to music or shop online.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
AI gives us recommendations about what we might like.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:17,000
AI is capable of converting spoken language into text and translating it into other languages.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
AI is a central component of robotics.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Robots make our everyday lives easier or take on strenuous activities.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Self-driving vehicles recognize their environment through AI and can react to it.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
AI is becoming increasingly important within medicine.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It supports doctors when diagnosing diseases.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Also, more and more patients use AI-based apps for initial diagnosis.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
In the educational sector, AI helps to individualise learning activities, for example, on digital learning platforms.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
AI is becoming increasingly important.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Once we understand how AI works, we can better gauge where it can support everyday activities at home and at work.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And where we would rather make our own decisions.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
AI will not replace humans, but it is getting better and better at supporting us.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
For this, we need an AI-competent society.
